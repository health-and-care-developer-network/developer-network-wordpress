                <h2>The path to publication on the NHS Apps Library</h2>
                <h4>What is the NHS Apps Library and how do you get your app on there?</h4>
                <p>
                  The new NHS Apps Library (apps.beta.nhs.uk) has been launched as a beta site.
                  It provides citizens, patients and clinicians with a trusted selection of digital health and
                  well-being applications.
                  This enables patients and citizens to access health care related tools that have been designed and tested to
                  support the self-management and prevention of health related conditions.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These pages provide options to developers who have existing health apps they would like to
                  see on the library. It also provides options for those of you who are interested in the
                  library or have an idea for a health app that they'd like to develop.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  All apps must be pass through an assessment to ensure that only trusted, high quality apps
                  are available on the Apps Library. We are currently focusing on UK produced apps that are
                  in public use. They must also be available in known app stores, such as Google Play and
                  The App Store. The library does not host apps, it provides links to the stores.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The NHS is working to update and enhance these pages and the experience for app developers.
                  To do this we are testing concepts, designs and user experience and we are actively seek
                  feedback from developers. <br/>
                </p>

                <h4>Assessment Process</h4>
                <p>
                  In order to drive and maintain a high quality offering of products on the NHS Apps Library we have
                  devised a Digital Assessment Questionnaire and review process that enables developers to self-assess
                  against relevant national standards and best practices.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The digital assessment questionnaire and assessment review process is being tested live to
                  enable a collaboration environment for developers, health care professionals and patients.
                  This supports us in the development of a fit-for-purpose process that is efficient and effective.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the process flow below shows, once you have submitted your app for assessment it will go through
                  a pre-assessment process at NHS Digital to determine if your app is the type of app we are
                  currently assessing. If it qualifies, you will be invited to take part in the app assessment by
                  answering the digital assessment questions.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you submit your self-assessment answers, they will be reviewed by our subject
                  matter experts; these are specialists in various fields (regulatory, clinical safety etc.).
                  At the moment, this is a largely manual process as we are currently developing the DAQs
                  and the overall assessment process. Response times and assessment times vary from app to
                  app depending on the complexity of the assessment.<br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When an app has successfully completed an assessment it will go through an on boarding
                  process and is ultimately published on the NHS Apps Library.<br/>
                </p>
